# Ideas

Things worth considering but not yet picked up. Lower the bar for adding —
write the context now so the rationale doesn't get lost; we can prune later.

## Auto-refresh a review when the underlying branch moves

`service::refresh_review` re-resolves a review's revset and appends a
new patchset (fast-forward vs rewritten is recorded via the
`parent_patchset` field on `Patchset`). It's invoked through explicit
user action (the refresh button) or the MCP `refresh_review` tool, and
the background watcher pings the UI via `Event::ReviewBranchMoved`
when the branch has moved — but only the human/agent decides whether
to actually advance the manifest. A more "magic" alternative:

- **Refresh implicitly inside `open_review`.** Every pageload would pick
  up new commits. Cost: one extra `jj log` per view. Bigger concern: a
  passive viewer's mere act of opening a review would create new
  patchsets, which can race with the author still rebasing or amending.
  Probably acceptable if we debounce ("only if no refresh in the last
  N seconds") and skip when the review is anchored to an explicit
  patchset via the URL.

## Smarter scoping for the branch watcher

The current watcher (`spawn_branch_watcher`) re-resolves every review's
revset every tick. That's one `jj log` per review per tick, which is
fine for a handful of reviews and silly for a hundred. Options:

- **Scope to reviews with active SSE subscribers.** The event bus
  already knows who's listening; the watcher could iterate only the
  subset that anyone actually cares about right now.
- **Dedup by revset.** Multiple reviews on `trunk()..feature-X` for
  different bookmarks all resolve the same expression — one call could
  serve all of them.
- **Watch `.jj/repo/op_heads`** instead of polling. React to jj
  operations directly; on each op-id change, do one full pass.

Also: the watcher's in-memory state map (`(RepoId, ReviewId) →
(tip, base)`) never prunes entries for reviews that were deleted from
storage. Minor memory leak, easy fix when we add a real review-delete
path.
